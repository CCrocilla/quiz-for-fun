## **Features**
- ### *__Structure__*:
The Website is composed of 5 different pages. Each of these page has been structured in a simple, easy and user-friendly way. 
The Structure of the website and the components used are listed below:


- ### *__Home Page__*:
#### The Home Page shows the logo of the website on the top left of the page and a navigation bar menu on the top right.
#### A border and text color change animation activates when the user hover the mouse over the elements in the nav bar, highlighting the content. 
#### The active page change the default color of the text and the color of the border in the navigation bar menu when selected. 
#### Depending on the device used (if laptop, desktop, tablet or smartphone) the positions of the nav bar change, creating an hamburger menu that will be displayed on the top right part of the page to adapt the view for a highly responsive rendering. 
#### Those behaviours are consistent in all pages. 
#### Following from Logo and the nav bar, the user will see a Background Image inside of which there is a section dedicated to the game in the center of the page.
#### The Game Area shows a brief welcome message and the Start and Rules Buttons.
#### By clicking on the latter the instructions/rules of the game can be accessed opening a modal pop-up window. While, clicking on the Start button, the user is able to access a pre-quiz form area, where username (with a max of 8 characters), level of difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard) and categories (movie or videogames) can be selected. The level of difficulty will dictate the available time to answer each question going from 60 to 30 to 15 s depending on the Easy, Medium and Hard levels, respectively. These fields are mandatory, if not selected a warning message will appear to the user. Once this information is indicated, the game will start. 
#### All the information (Username and Difficulty) filled by the user is saved in the Local Storage of the browser and if the user access again the Pre-Quiz Game Area, the username will be automatically filled in. 

- ### *__Quiz Area__*:
 
#### The quiz questions are divided into two main categories, movies or video games. To win the game, the user needs to correctly answer 10 questions in the assigned time. For each question, the question number, the score and the available time are displayed on the top. 
#### The question with 4 possible answers are presented to the user, each button (with an answer) changes colour when the users hover the mouse over it. Once the answer is selected, a function in the JavaScript code section, will check and will assign a green or red colur if the answer is correct/incorrect, respectively. 
#### In the JavaScript code a function is used to randomly select over a larger available pool, the 10 questions shown in the game area. The random nature of this selection allows the user to be presented with different combination every time the game is played. Every timeWhenever  the users answer a question, the time counter is resented to the original level (depending on the level of difficulty), the score increases (if the correct answer is selected) and the question counter (question number) increases. 
#### When the user completes the game or if the available time runs out, he/she is redirected to the Scores Page, where a message provides feedback on the quality of the played game and where the user can select if he/she wants to save the final score into the leader board.

#### If the user clicks on the No button the Leader board will be retrieved displaying the Scores of other users using a fetch function with the GET method.

- ### **Forking the GitHub Repository**  
By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps:
1.	Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository
2.	At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button
3.	You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account


- ### **Local Clone**
By creating a Local Clone you will be able to create a copy of the repository that is avilable in your local computer.
In order to create a Local Clone follow the steps below: 
1.	Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository that you want to clone
2.	Click on the Code Button
3.	To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link
4.	Open Git Bash
5.	Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made
6.	Type git clone as shown in the example below and then paste the URL copied in Step 3
>$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
7. Press Enter 
8. Your local clone will be created

## **Credits**

Thanks to my Mentor, Narender Singh, for his guide and support for the realization of this project.
Thanks to the useful reference and suggestions derived from sources listed below, I manage to gain a deeper understanding of how the various elements/components of HTML, CSS and Javascript are used. In addition, continuous trial and error tests provided a useful means to further experiment on the usage of these three programming languages for the creation of the site.

- ### Content & Media
All of the contents on the website are customised and no design frameworks have been used for the realization of the site.
The idea of the Logo, the Navbar and the Footer were taken from the Love Running Project analysing and customizing their implementation for the created website and implementing an additional feature for the mobile version(Hamburger Menu).
In order to consolidate the knowledge acquired during the Code Institute Course dedicated to the javascript part (as well as the HTML and CSS) I have also studied and explored the writing part of the code and the best practices using the sites listed below.

One of the most complex part to develop for the website was the Quiz and the logic to apply. 
The following websites were inspirational and helped me understanding how to sctructure the logic on how to take the questions/answers and how to display them and let them be the element to click. Then I have customized and created the code for my needs:
- [Thanks to Brian Design for the video of How to make a Quiz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4fB9Xg2JEY&t=1874s)
- [Thanks to Web Dev Simplfied for the video of How to build a Quiz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riDzcEQbX6k&t=904s)
- [Thanks to Simple Step Code for the inspiration](https://simplestepscode.com/javascript-quiz-tutorial/)

Thanks to Narender Singh, who direct me toward the right path pushing and , I have also studied the Local Storage, that I have then used to store information such us Username, Difficulty selected and Score, and the possibility to use an Online NoSQL database backend (RestDB.io is one of the suggested ones) that I have studied and implemented in the website and it is used to save the Username, the Difficulty and the Score as well as display the leaderboard.
This was another of the most complex part to develop but thanks to the Code Institute Course (Introduction to APIs) and the following website/Youtube Videos I was able to understand, customized and create the code for my needs:
- [Local Storage - W3School.com](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_win_localstorage.asp)
- [Thanks to dcode for the Video on How to use Local Storage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8yJCeuP6I8)

To implement the favicon in the website was used the following resource:
- [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io/) 

For the realization of the 404 error page I found a guide on how to create the file here: 
- [Docs Github](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-custom-404-page-for-your-github-pages-site)

Thanks to Kasia Bogucka and Narender Singh for suggesting the use of github wiki site to create the Markdown file. They have also provided the link for the Sample Readme of Code Institute.
