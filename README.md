1.	Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository
2.	At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button
3.	You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account


- ### **Local Clone**
By creating a Local Clone you will be able to create a copy of the repository that is avilable in your local computer.
In order to create a Local Clone follow the steps below: 
1.	Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository that you want to clone
2.	Click on the Code Button
3.	To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link
4.	Open Git Bash
5.	Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made
6.	Type git clone as shown in the example below and then paste the URL copied in Step 3

## **Credits**

Thanks to my Mentor, Narender Singh, for his guide and support in the realization of this project.
Thanks to the useful reference and suggestions derived from sources listed below, I manage to gain a deeper understanding of how the various elements/components of HTML, CSS and Javascript are used. In addition, continuous trial and error tests provided a useful means to further experiment on the usage of these three programming languages for the creation of the site.

- ### Content & Media
All of the contents on the website are customised and no design frameworks have been used for the realization of the site.
The idea of the Logo, the Navbar and the Footer were taken from the Love Running Project analysing and customizing their implementation for the created website.
I explored the writing part of the code and the best practices associated to this using the two sites listed below. Consulting those allowed me to further cement the learning gained during the Code Institute Course.
- [Medium.com](https://medium.com/@inceptiondj.info/html-css-coding-best-practice-fadb9870a00f)
- [Learn.shayhowe.com](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/writing-your-best-code/)

One of the most complex pages for the implementation of the website was the Recipes Page. My mentor Narender Singh (Mentor) provided some materials where I could observe and study the implementation of sliders using only css with no JavaScript, generally used for these types of tasks. 

The following websites were inspirational for customizing the code of the slider to my needs:
- [Thanks to Chris Coyier for the Slider](https://codepen.io/chriscoyier/pen/XwbNwX)

- [Thanks to Anna Blok for the Popup](https://codepen.io/anna_blok/pen/KKpwRVe)

- [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io/) was used to include the favicon in the website.
- [Cooks.com](https://www.cooks.com/) was used as reference for the creation of the recipes. 


For the realization of the 404 error page I found a guide on how to create the file here: 
- [Docs Github](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-custom-404-page-for-your-github-pages-site)

Thanks to Kasia Bogucka and Narender Singh for suggesting the use of github wiki site to create the Markdown file. They have also provided the link for the Sample Readme of Code Institute.

- [Markdown - Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

Thank you to the entire Code Institute Team and the Slack Community for their feedback, help and support.
